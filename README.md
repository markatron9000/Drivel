# Drivel
A custom programming language which is centered around using an excessive amount of semicolons.
### NOTE: This project uses, as a starter, the base from CodePulses' wonderful series on creating a custom programming language, which you can see [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eythq9848Fg&list=PLZQftyCk7_SdoVexSmwy_tBgs7P0b97yD) Credit goes to them for the starter.
